# What We'd Like To Do

- **Provide as complete a picture** as possible of student activism at Swarthmore in the early 1960s
- **Assemble historical materials**, from archival records and photographs to letters and diaries to published accounts
- **Fill in the details** through conducting oral histories with those who participated
- **Share what we find** by putting our collections online for students and researchers currently working in field and those who may do so in the future

# Why This Is Important

The early 1960s was a time of social activism at Swarthmore. The Civil Rights Movement was already well underway and many students were ready to get involved. The college’s Quaker roots provided one source for the activism because of the strong values of equality between genders, races, and ethnic groups. Swarthmore also attracted students who brought an enthusiasm for organizing. The decade’s fervor for change was underway.

During the summers, students spread out to work in numerous projects in the South, some of which were run or sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee. During the school year, students became active in Chester, firstly in desegregating an ice skating rink, then in setting up a tutoring program, and later in community organizing and protests to improve the schools. Finally they helped set up CHIP (Chester Home Improvement Project), which was a local version of what Habitat for Humanity became. Students also joined with Gloria Richardson and CNAC (Cambridge Nonviolent Action Committee) in Cambridge, Maryland, to organize, protest and improve conditions there. SNCC was active in Cambridge and at least two Swarthmore students became full-time workers for SNCC. Some of this work has been described in articles and books, but none of these accounts bring the personalities of the Swarthmore activists and leaders alive the way that direct records from them or their close friends and co-activists can. That is one goal for proposing a project to obtain as direct records as possible of the many activities and to fill in critical details about this activist period in college history. We know that current student activists are interested in learning about and from those who came before. We will also document the diversity of projects in which Swarthmore students worked and learn how their initial idealism was tempered by the dangers and threats that arose when they were fully active in the protests and projects.

# Why We Need To Do This Now

As many of the activists who participated are either Garnet Sages or about to become such, now is a key time to record their memories and reflections on their civil rights activism during their time at Swarthmore. The panel discussion by activists at the 50th Reunion this past June for the Class of 1966 was a highlight of the reunion for many in the class. Some alums also have collections of letters that their parents and friends saved which tell of their work as they did it, and some alums may even have diaries with descriptions of their activities. We have a window of a few years when memories are sharp enough that we can gather the stories, learn of the personalities, bring the times and people alive again, and add materially to the documentary evidence for this period of activism by various students and even some faculty.
